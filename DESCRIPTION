Description:
    Solve optimization problems using an R interface to NLopt. NLopt is a free/open-source library for
    nonlinear optimization, providing a common interface for a number of
    different free optimization routines available online as well as original
    implementations of various other algorithms.
    See http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Introduction for more
    information on the available algorithms. During installation of nloptr on 
    Unix-based sytems, the installer checks whether the NLopt library is
    installed on the system. If the NLopt library cannot be found, the code
    is downloaded and compiled from the NLopt website.
