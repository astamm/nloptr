Description:
    nloptr is an R interface to NLopt. NLopt is a free/open-source library for
    nonlinear optimization, providing a common interface for a number of
    different free optimization routines available online as well as original
    implementations of various other algorithms.
    See http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Introduction for more
    information on the available algorithms. During installation on Unix the
