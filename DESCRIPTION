Description: 
    Solve optimization problems using an R interface to NLopt. NLopt is a 
    free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization, providing a common
    interface for a number of different free optimization routines available
    online as well as original implementations of various other algorithms.
    See <https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Algorithms/> for more
    information on the available algorithms. Building from included sources 
    requires 'CMake'. On Linux and 'macOS', if a suitable system build of 
    NLopt (2.7.0 or later) is found, it is used; otherwise, it is built 
    from included sources via 'CMake'. On Windows, NLopt is obtained through 
    'rwinlib' for 'R <= 4.1.x' or grabbed from the 'Rtools42 toolchain' for 
    'R >= 4.2.0'.

SystemRequirements: cmake (>= 3.2.0) which is used only on Linux or macOS 
    systems when no system build of nlopt (>= 2.7.0) can be found.
