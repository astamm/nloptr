02 August 2014, version 1.0.4:
    * Increased version number to re-submit package to CRAN with CRLF line endings removed for configure and configure.ac.

25 July 2014, version 1.0.3:
    * Changed NLOPT_VERSION to 2.4.2 for Linux.
    * Changed nloptr.default.options from a data.frame to a function returning the data.frame.

25 July 2014, version 1.0.2:
    * Added configure script which tests for a system NLopt library via pkg-config and uses it if it is sufficiently recent (ie 2.4.*), and otherwise configure downloads, patches and builds the NLopt sources just how src/Makevars used to (thanks to Dirk Eddelbuettel).

05 May 2014, version 1.0.1:
* All unit tests are now enabled and use the package testthat. Install the package with argument INSTALL_opt = "--install-tests" supplied to install.packages to install the tests. The tests can be run after installation with test_package('nloptr'). The testthat package needs to be installed and loaded to be able to run the tests.
    * Changed default value for maxtime option from 0.0 to -1.0. In some cases nloptr returned NLOPT_MAXTIME_REACHED without running any iterations with the default setting. This change solves this.
    * Replaced cat by message or warning. Messages can be suppressed by suppressMessages.

27 January 2014, version 1.0.0:
    * Merged wrappers from the 'nloptwrap' package.

19 November 2013, version 0.9.6:
    * Added a line in Makevars to replace some code in NLopt to fix compilation on Solaris as requested by Brian Ripley.

12 November 2013, version 0.9.5:
    * Updated references from NLopt version 2.3 to NLopt version 2.4 in installation instructions in INSTALL.windows.
    * Added a line in Makevars that replaces some code related to type-casting in NLopt-2.4/isres/isres.c.
    * Changed encoding of src/nloptr.c from CP1252 to UTF-8.    

09 November 2013, version 0.9.4:
    * Updated NLopt to version 2.4.
    * Changed tests to use unit testing package testthat (these are currently disabled).
    * Fixed a segfault that started to occur on the latest version of Ubuntu.
    * Slightly changed the build process (Removed -lstdc++ from linker statement. A file dummy.cpp (with C++ extension)
      is added to the source directory to ensure linking with C++. Thanks to Brian Ripley for bringing this up.)

31 July 2013, version 0.9.3:
    * Split lines longer than 100 characters in check.derivatives examples in two lines to comply with new package rules.
    * Moved vignettes from inst/doc to vignettes to comply with new package rules.
    * Removed dependency on apacite in vignette as an update of apacite on CRAN resulted in errors.

11 July 2013, version 0.9.2:
    * Made changes in bibtex file of documentation.
    * Removed CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS from Makevars.

version 0.9.0:
    * Introduced new print_level = 3. Shows values of controls (16 April 2012 on R-Forge).
    * Changed Makevars and Makevars.win to link to version 2.3 of NLopt compiled with --with-cxx option. This makes the StoGo algorithm available. (31 April 2013 on R-Forge).

18 November 2011, version 0.8.9:

    * Changed CRLF and CR line endings in src/Makevars to LF line endings to remove a warning from R CMD check.
    * Adopted some changes proposed by Brian Ripley to src/Makevars.win in order for nloptr to work with his new toolchain.

28 September 2011, version 0.8.8:

	* Updated src/Makevars to compile on Solaris.
	
24 September 2011, version 0.8.7:

	* Updated src/Makevars to compile on Solaris.

19 September 2011, version 0.8.6:

	* Updated src/Makevars to compile on Solaris.

03 September 2011, version 0.8.5:

	* Updated src/Makevars to compile a working binary for MacOS.

12 August 2011, version 0.8.4:

	* added new options:
		- data/nloptr.default.options.R: new file with a description of all options, mostly taken from the NLopt website (for internal use).
		- R/nloptr.print.options.R: function to show the description for a specific (set of) option(s). 
		  E.g. nloptr.print.options( option="maxeval" )
		  nloptr.print.options() shows a description of all options if called without arguments.
		- added option to print a description of all options and their values ('print_options_doc' = TRUE/FALSE).
		- added option population to set the population of stochastic/global solvers ('population' = 1000).
		- added option ranseed which sets the random seed for stochastic solvers ('ranseed' = 3141). A value of 0 uses a random seed generated by system time.
		- option check_derivatives is no longer listed as a termination condition.
		- documented the option to set the tolerance of (in)equality constraints (tol_constraints_eq, tol_constraints_ineq).
		
	* tests/banana_global.R: new test file that uses the algorithms (CRS, ISRES, MLSL) and options ranseed and population.
	
	* src/nloptr.c: capture error codes from setting options.

	* R/nloptr.print.R: output gives 'optimal value of controls' when status = -4 (some error code), this is changed to 'current value of controls'.
