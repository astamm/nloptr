# 09 June 2011: Windows support added thanks to Stefan Theussl and Uwe Ligges.
#               NLOPT_HOME is the directory where a working installation of
#               NLopt is located (within subdirectories NLOPT_VERSION/R_ARCH)
# 18 November 2011: Removed NLOPT_VERSION macro and adopted some other changes
#                   proposed by Brian Ripley to make nloptr work with his new toolchain.
#                   NLopt should now be located in NLOPT_HOME/R_ARCH (i.e. without
#                   version number)
# 19 February 2013: NLopt is compiled with --with-cxx option, in order to include
#                   the StoGo algorithm. This means that we now need to link to
#                   with -lnlopt_cxx and also link to the c++ library, -lstdc++.
# 7 November 2013: Changed PKG_CPPFLAGS to PKG_CFLAGS.
# 2 May 2014: Added quotes around include paths to allow for spaces in NLOPT_HOME.
# 8 November 2019: Removed architecture subdirectories and updated library names
#                  and dependencies for NLOPT 2.6.1 (2.5+) {Avraham Adler}

# C Compiler options
PKG_CFLAGS = -I"$(NLOPT_HOME)/include"
PKG_LIBS = -L"$(NLOPT_HOME)/lib" -lnlopt -lm -lstdc++
